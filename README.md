# Neural-Machine-translation_with_Attention
 notebook with multiiple attention techniques (Bhadnau and Luong) with different alignment model

## These Notebooks are base on Global attention approach(all source wordss are consideres)

Taken help from these paper
for Luong https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025
for bahdanau https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473



---> Attention approach used are (bhadnau and Luong)

---> Alignment model approaches used are (Dot,general,concat)
